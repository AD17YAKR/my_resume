Each bullet follows the HAMS method:

    Hard Skill: Hard skill tailored to the job Iâ€™m interested in (in this case, Strategy & Operations)
    Action Verbs: Powerful words to start each bullet point (managed, collaborated)
    Metrics: Show impact in your current & previous roles ($1.6 million budget, 15% YTD)
    Structure: Each bullet follows the same structure -> Responsibility, followed by the impact
