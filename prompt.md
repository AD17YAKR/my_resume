I have a resume in HTML format that I plan to convert to PDF later, so the current style and UI must remain unchanged. I need you to optimize this resume for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) by incorporating a curated list of industry-specific keywords and phrases directly into the HTML content. Please ensure the following:
Preserve HTML Style/UI: Use the provided HTML as a base without modifying its visual design, layout, or UI elements.
ATS Keyword Integration: Seamlessly insert the given ATS-friendly keywords into the content, ensuring that they are naturally integrated into sections such as Professional Summary, Work Experience, Skills, and Certifications.
Content Refinement: Remove any outdated, irrelevant, or redundant points from the resume. Add impactful details that highlight my key skills, experiences, accomplishments, and industry certifications.
Semantic Markup: Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) to organize the content clearly, which will help both ATS and human recruiters.
Final Output: Provide the updated HTML code along with a list of all the ATS keywords that have been included.
The goal is to enhance the resumeâ€™s visibility in ATS without affecting the overall design, as the final layout is crucial for the PDF conversion process.
