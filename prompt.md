Analyze my existing resume (provided below) and perform these ATS optimization enhancements without altering the current styling/layout:
Keyword Integration:
Identify 15-20 missing technical keywords from these categories:
[Insert your target job's key requirements from description]
(e.g., CI/CD, Cloud Platforms, SDLC, Agile Methodologies, REST APIs, Test-Driven Development)
Naturally incorporate keywords into existing bullet points (no keyword stuffing)
Quantification Boost:
Convert 3 generic achievements to metrics-driven statements
(Example: "Conducted code reviews" → "Performed 50+ weekly code reviews maintaining 98% compliance with SonarQube standards")
Strategic Removals:
Remove redundant coursework (keep only DSA and OS)
Eliminate duplicate metrics (appears in both EzeRx achievements)
Remove version-less technologies ("Android" → "Android SDK")
Technical Depth Additions:
Add 2-3 sentence technical context before achievements:
"Leveraged Python's Pandas library to automate..."
"Utilized Docker containerization in AWS EC2 environment to..."
Certification Spotlight:
Create dedicated certifications section if missing
Include exam codes if applicable (AWS-SAA, Python Institute PCAP)
Compliance Check:
Ensure all dates follow ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM)
Verify consistent special character usage (% vs percent)
Add alt-text descriptors for semantic HTML elements
Role-Specific Toggle:
Create commented alternative bullet points for:
Mobile Developer roles (Flutter, Dart, Kotlin)
Backend roles (Spring Boot, Microservices, API Design)
Full Stack roles (MERN Stack, Cloud Integration)
Deliverables:
Optimized HTML with revision markers
Keyword implementation report showing before/after changes
Priority list for future updates based on target roles"\*\*
This version maintains your structure while focusing on:
Machine readability through semantic HTML
Keyword density optimization
Technical specificity improvements
ATS-friendly formatting standards
Role-specific adaptability

I have a resume in HTML format that I plan to convert to PDF later, so the current style and UI must remain unchanged. I need you to optimize this resume for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) by incorporating a curated list of industry-specific keywords and phrases directly into the HTML content. Please ensure the following:
Preserve HTML Style/UI: Use the provided HTML as a base without modifying its visual design, layout, or UI elements.
ATS Keyword Integration: Seamlessly insert the given ATS-friendly keywords into the content, ensuring that they are naturally integrated into sections such as Professional Summary, Work Experience, Skills, and Certifications.
Content Refinement: Remove any outdated, irrelevant, or redundant points from the resume. Add impactful details that highlight my key skills, experiences, accomplishments, and industry certifications.
Semantic Markup: Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) to organize the content clearly, which will help both ATS and human recruiters.
Final Output: Provide the updated HTML code along with a list of all the ATS keywords that have been included.
The goal is to enhance the resume’s visibility in ATS without affecting the overall design, as the final layout is crucial for the PDF conversion process.
